## Security Endpoints

### üìä Monitoring Endpoints

All security endpoints require strict rate limiting (3 requests/minute).

#### Get Security Statistics
```http
GET /api/v1/security/stats/
```

Returns comprehensive security statistics including:
- Hourly and daily attack counts
- Top attacking IPs
- Attack type distribution
- Threat level analysis

#### Get Recent Security Events
```http
GET /api/v1/security/events/recent/?limit=50
```

Returns recent security events with details:
- Attack type and threat level
- IP address and user agent
- Endpoint targeted
- Timestamp and additional data

#### Get Blocked IPs
```http
GET /api/v1/security/blocked-ips/
```

Returns list of blocked IP addresses with:
- Block reason and duration
- Block timestamp and expiration
- Attack history

#### Generate Security Report
```http
GET /api/v1/security/report/
```

Generates comprehensive security report including:
- Attack summary and trends
- Threat distribution analysis
- Security recommendations
- Recent events and blocked IPs

### üîß Management Endpoints

#### Block IP Address
```http
POST /api/v1/security/block-ip/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "reason": "Manual block - suspicious activity",
  "duration_hours": 24
}
```

#### Unblock IP Address
```http
DELETE /api/v1/security/unblock-ip/192.168.1.100
```

#### Clear Security Events
```http
DELETE /api/v1/security/events/clear/
```

## Attack Types and Threat Levels

### Attack Types

| Type | Description | Response |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests from single IP | Rate limiting |
| `ddos_attempt` | DDoS attack pattern detected | IP blocking |
| `prompt_injection` | Malicious AI prompt detected | Request rejection |
| `sql_injection` | SQL injection attempt | Request rejection |
| `suspicious_user_agent` | Bot/automated tool detected | Logging only |
| `large_payload` | Unusually large request | Request rejection |
| `blocked_ip_access` | Access from blocked IP | Access denied |

### Threat Levels

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `low` | Minor security concern | Logged for monitoring |
| `medium` | Moderate threat | Rate limiting applied |
| `high` | Serious threat | May result in IP blocking |
| `critical` | Severe threat | Immediate IP blocking |

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring

The security system provides real-time monitoring of:
- Attack attempts and patterns
- Rate limit violations
- IP blocking events
- System health and performance

### Log Analysis

Security events are logged with structured data:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1640995200.0,
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "attack_type": "prompt_injection",
  "threat_level": "high",
  "endpoint": "/api/v1/search/",
  "user_agent": "curl/7.68.0",
  "blocked_content": "ignore previous instructions..."
}
```

### Automated Responses

The system automatically responds to threats:
- **Rate Limiting**: Temporary request throttling
- **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking for severe threats
- **Request Rejection**: Immediate rejection of malicious requests
- **Alert Generation**: Real-time security alerts

## Best Practices

### üîê Security Hardening

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Strong Authentication**: Implement proper API authentication
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor security endpoints regularly
5. **Backup**: Regular backup of security configurations

### üöÄ Performance Optimization

1. **Redis Optimization**: Use Redis clustering for high traffic
2. **Rate Limit Tuning**: Adjust limits based on traffic patterns
3. **Log Management**: Implement log rotation and archival
4. **Cache Management**: Monitor Redis memory usage

### üìà Scaling Considerations

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Use Redis cluster for multiple instances
2. **Load Balancer Integration**: Configure rate limiting at load balancer
3. **Geographic Blocking**: Consider geographic IP restrictions
4. **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for additional DDoS protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High False Positives
- Adjust prompt injection patterns
- Whitelist legitimate user agents
- Tune rate limiting thresholds

#### Performance Impact
- Optimize Redis configuration
- Reduce logging verbosity
- Implement caching strategies

#### Blocked Legitimate Users
- Review blocking criteria
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Adjust threat level thresholds

### Emergency Procedures

#### Under Attack
1. Monitor security dashboard
2. Identify attack patterns
3. Implement emergency rate limits
4. Block attacking IP ranges
5. Contact hosting provider if needed

#### System Recovery
1. Assess damage and impact
2. Review security logs
3. Update security configurations
4. Implement additional protections
5. Document lessons learned
